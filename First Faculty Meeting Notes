First goal: design your "pallete" and a method and a method for  generating a packing
compute the density.

No overlapping

computing desity

rigid frame

upper bound on the density

Ali: finding clever ways
locally dense
Chemisty

r/2 and r density: efficiency gain:
if ration is close enough .77 and 1: overall density cannot be pi/sqrt(12)
if smaller, then there is effi gains
laso gawish too
is radius is epsilon close
then August florean
90% still can't eff
1975-6: germany gullard lift
77%: still can't get a gain, 
Kennedy, see places where you can do better.

Homogeneity

Cannot reach density one with two spheres, turtles all the way down.

Compute the 99% limit. Maximum density limit for a single radius packing pi/sqrt()

finding the shape of the curve: 

mid semester: plan to have some kind of graphically
