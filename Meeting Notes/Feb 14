Taking the density from multiple samples in the palette.
Finding the saturated packing 

Collecting data on palette.
single species: achieve 90%

Bi-species:
r=.5
r=1
density more than 90%

Determine:
is packing saturated?
is there any intersections?






***
one and one: could be different probabilities?
