Week 1 : 1/31/18

First goal: Design your "palette" and a method for generating a packing, and compute the density

-Use any language
-Start with a single radius
-Graph on a density vs. iterations plot
-The canvas size should be large enough to nearly simulate an infinite boundary

-This can be compared to the ethanol-alcohol mixture.
	—-If only using radius 1, the limit is pi/rt(12)
	—-If only using radius 1/2, the limit is pi/rt(12)
	—-If using both, there must be a bowl-like shape on a volume vs. ratio graph

For Friday:
How to generate a palette (which size)
How to fill the space
How to calculate density

Challenge:
Prove the pi/rt(12) limit
Find the theoretical limit to a packing with 2 radii
